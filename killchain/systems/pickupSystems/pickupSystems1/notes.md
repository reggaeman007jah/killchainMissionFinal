These notes should help me keep track of this system, and the thoughts I have on improving it.

It is shakey as hell, and prone to poor UX unless used specifically .. it needs to be more robust.

One major issue is that I cannot currently operate things form one file, I need to duplicate things - this is horrible
but does enable quick play-testing

I have created a second version for a second heli
I am also reducing the landing / disembarking marker size
