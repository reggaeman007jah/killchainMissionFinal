Refactor of Killchain Mission

To start the mission, go to the office, walk up to the office, walk up to the clerk to start the mission

Once the mission starts, INDIFOR AI troops will move out automatically to assault the nearest objective

When they win the battle, they will defend that point against OPFOR QRF. Once the battle is won, INDIFOR will progress to the next objective.

There are 6 objectives, and one final fortress-level objective
